# Kubernetes Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project sets up a monitoring stack on Kubernetes using Prometheus and Grafana. It includes:

- **Prometheus**: A powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Grafana**: A popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, kind, or managed Kubernetes)
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- `git` for version control

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create the Monitoring Namespace**

   First, create a namespace for monitoring:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace monitoring
   ```

2. **Deploy Prometheus**

   - Apply the Prometheus ConfigMap:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f manifests/prometheus/prometheus-configmap.yaml
     ```

   - Apply the Prometheus Deployment and Service:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f manifests/prometheus/prometheus-deployment.yaml
     ```

3. **Deploy Grafana**

   - Apply the Grafana Deployment and Service:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f manifests/grafana/grafana-deployment.yaml
     ```

4. **Access Grafana**

   - Forward the Grafana service port to your local machine:

     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward svc/grafana -n monitoring 3000:3000
     ```

   - Once the port is forwarded, you can access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
